# Abstract
Channel state information (CSI) estimation is a critical issue in the design of modern massive 
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks. With the increasing number of users, assigning 
orthogonal pilots to everyone incurs a large overhead that strongly penalizes the spectral 
efficiency (SE) of the system. It becomes thus necessary to reuse pilots, giving rise to pilot 
contamination, a vital performance bottleneck of mMIMO networks. Reusing pilots among the users 
of a same cell is a very desirable operation condition from the perspective of reducing training 
overheads; however, the intra-cell pilot contamination might become even worse due to the proximity 
of the users. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which are capable of smartly controlling 
the wireless channel, can be leveraged to achieve intra-cell pilot reuse. In this paper, our main 
contribution is an RIS-aided approach for intra-cell pilot reuse and the corresponding channel 
estimation method. Relying upon the knowledge of only statistical CSI, we then optimize the RIS 
phase-shifts based on a manifold optimization framework and the RIS positioning based on a 
deterministic approach. The extensive numerical results highlight the remarkable performance 
improvements achieved by the proposed scheme (for both uplink and donwlink transmissions) in 
comparison with other alternatives.
